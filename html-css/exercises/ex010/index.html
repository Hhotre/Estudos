    <h1>Links</h1>
    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>To make a text turn into a link we must use tag A</p>  
    <p>Click <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/junckes/">here</a> to view my linkedin profile.</p>
    <p>To make that we dont exit the main site, we must add to the A tag this: target="_blank rel="external"</p>
    <p>This is my <a href="https://github.com/Hhotre" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub</a> profile</p>
    <h2>Internal Links</h2>
    <p>To make a internal link to my other website we simply create a new page and link to it, using the link methods</p>
    <p>This is my second <a href="page002.html" target="_self" rel="next">page</a></p>
    <p>To make a better semantics, we can use REL, to say to the navigation system what page is next and what page is previous</p>
    <p>We can use rel='nofollow' to websites that have no relations with our server, like a sponsorship site</p>
    <p>Visit my sponsorship <a href="https://worthouse.com/" rel="nofollow">Worthouse</a></p>
    <p>As instructed, we use _blank to go to other website, but there is a target that we can use to our on website, called _SELF, this is the right semantics.</p>
